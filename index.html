                        Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. <br>"Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. 
                        <br>The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.
                        <br>Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.
                        <br> The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion it began with certain core applications of  pre-Socratic philosophers and has steadily gained currency ever since.
